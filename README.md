# W420-Vibration-Sensor-In-Go

After completing finishing our basement with a powder room, observed the effluent pump shook the plumbing hard.
Began to wonder about sensing the vibration and this idea became this project.

Found a cheap vibration sensor on Adafruit and even bought prototyping boards, wires, and resistors.
Then found the SW-420 sensor on Amazon and wire one up to a Raspberry Pi Zero2 to which I soldered a GPIO header.

The RPiZ2H was already being used as a PiHole.
Attached it and the SW-420 to the plumbing with wire ties and began the coding.
